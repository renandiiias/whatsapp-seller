This file, index.js, is the main entry point for a WhatsApp bot. It uses the whatsapp-web.js library to interact with WhatsApp, axios to make HTTP requests to the OpenRouter API, qrcode-terminal to display QR codes in the terminal, qr-image to generate QR code images, and fs to handle file system operations. The bot initializes a WhatsApp client, generates a QR code for authentication, and listens for incoming messages. When a message is received from a specific phone number, it sends the message to the OpenRouter API to generate a response and then replies to the message with the generated response.
